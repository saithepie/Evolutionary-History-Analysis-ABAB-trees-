0) A positive or negative D statistic signifies the direction of admixture. A positive D statistic means that the BABA count is more than the ABBA count, indicating that there is gene flow between Population 1 to Population 3 (Chimp to the other population) and Population 2 (Neanderthal/Denisovan) has more gene Flow to population 4. A negative D statistic indicates that the ABBA count is more than the BABA count, showing that the gene flow of Population 1 to Population 4 is there and Population 2 (Neanderthal/Denisovan) flows more to population 3. With the Neanderthal/Denisovan being analyzed, a positive D statistic indicates a flow between Population 2 and 4 and a negative D statistic indicates a flow between Population 2 and 3.

1) According to my file, there has been admixture between Neanderthals/Denisovans and Anatomically Modern Humans. For Neanderthals, almost all pairs tended to have a significant Z score and admixture except the pairs of Dan-British and Yoruba-Mbuti with lower Z scores that weren't significant and didn't indicate admixture in some direction. For Denisovans, except Dai-British, Dai-Yoruba, and Yoruba-Mbuti, which did not have significant Z scores for the D statistic, every other population pair of Anatomically Modern Humans had admixture between them. More information can be found in the data table.

2) Although there is a scarcity of archaic genomes from Africa, it does not necessarily imply that archaic admixture did not occur in modern African populations overall. One of the biases to mention is the current unavailability of ancient DNA from Africa may have hindered the detection of archaic admixture in this region. Moreover, the absence of archaic genomes from Africa, while present in Europe and Asia, may lead to a biased understanding of the distribution and extent of archaic admixture. To gain a more accurate understanding of human admixture history, it is crucial to conduct further research and discover ancient DNA from Africa.

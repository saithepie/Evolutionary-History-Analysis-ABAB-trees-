# Evolutionary-History-Analysis-ABAB-trees-
Uses a chart of ABABA differences from a human sequence file and deconstructs it using R slicing and data changing techniques to derive a chart of accurately based statistics. Basic conclusions are also given as a supplement in the file to summarize analysis of the evolutionary trees.
